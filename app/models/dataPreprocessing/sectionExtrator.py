"""
    Extracts specific sections from a given text, including skills, education, and work experience.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The input text containing information about skills, education, and work experience.

    Returns:
    A tuple containing three elements:
    - skills (str or None): Extracted skills section from the input text.
    - education (str or None): Extracted education section from the input text.
    - experience (str or None): Extracted work experience section from the input text.

    The function uses regular expressions to identify and extract each section based on predefined patterns.

    Example:
    >>> resume_text = "Skills: Python, Java. Education: Master's in Computer Science. Company: ABC Inc."
    >>> extract_sections(resume_text)
    ('Python, Java', "Master's in Computer Science", 'ABC Inc.')

    Note:
    Ensure that the regular expressions cover various cases and variations in the input text to improve accuracy.
